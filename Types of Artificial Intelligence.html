Type 1 – Based on Functionality
1. Reactive Machine
They are the most basic and oldest type of Artificial Intelligence. They replicate a human’s ability to react to different kinds of stimuli. This type of AI has no memory power, so they lack the capability to use previously gained information/experience to obtain better results. Therefore, these kinds of AI don’t have the ability to train themselves like the ones we come across nowadays.
2. Limited Theory
These type of AI, along with the ability of Reactive Machines, have memory capabilities so they can use past information/experience to make better future decisions. Most of the common applications existing around us fall under this category. These AI applications can be trained by a large volume of training data they store in their memory in a reference model.
