1.Transport industry
The transport sector is one of the most important sectors which can be impacted through the rise of
artificial intelligence. At some point or the other, human beings will hand over keys to computers
because a driverless car will soon become reality. But the impact of artificial intelligence goes much
deeper than this because very soon commercial truck companies, airlines, and trains can soon become
driverless which is great advancement as it will free up resources and time in a drastic manner.
2.Journalism
Artificial intelligence is transforming the world of journalism with new methods of gaining and collectinginformation.
Many news articles are now days not written by human beings but are offloaded to an artificial intelligent source.
These sources are capable of discerning information and can put together articles in a manner that is completely understandable and sane
